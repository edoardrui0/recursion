# Recursion
A Ruby implementation of recursion using the Fibonacci algorithm and the Merge Sort algorithm

## Overview
This is a show of understanding when it comes to algorithms. Taking this from The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-recursion#project-solution) <br />
1. **Fiboacci Sequence** : A mathematical sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...)
2. **Merge Sort** : A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that efficiently sorts arrays by recursively breaking them down into smaller subarrays
